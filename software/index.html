                Hello! My name is Spencer Johnson, and I think software is amazing. As a father of two, I want my children 
                to grow up able to safely and productively use technology and the internet. My own journey into software 
                development has shown me both how useful the tools are that are available to us and also how dangerous they 
                can be. As such, I want my children to be as prepared as possible to engage computers and the internet with 
                intelligence and care. Beyond these goals, working in software as a field is a fun and rewarding career path 
                that can be opened up to our children with a little bit of hard work and an opportunity to learn. That's why 
                I started Goshen Software.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p style = "text-indent: 1em;">
                I teach courses over Zoom on a semester rotation, starting with an introduction to computers, and going all the 
                way to "full-stack" software development. I've designed the rotation of courses to allow students who move all 
                the way through from start to end to have enough of a foundation to either thrive in a trade-school setting for 
                software development, or even move directly into internships in the field. If you are interested in signing 
                up for a course, or you'd like to schedule a meet-and-greet to get to know me and learn more about the program, 
                feel free to <span style="text-decoration: underline; " onclick="copyEmail()" class="email">email</span> me and 
                I'd be happy to schedule something with you. Check out the course catalog and the FAQ sections below for more information.

                <p>
                    The registration fee for each course is $400, and is due one week before classes start. If you have 
                    multiple children taking courses, there is a discount available for each additional child.

                <p class="question">
                    What do we need to sign up?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enrollment in a Goshen Software course requires the following:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Access to a computer and internet with sufficient speeds to attend live Zoom meetings. 
                            Download speeds should be at least 15 mbps. This can be checked at www.speedtest.net.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Computer hardware: A mouse, webcam, and microphone. Laptops today usually have webcams 
                            and microphones built in. If you donâ€™t have a webcam, I can provide recommendations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Homework during the week will need around 2 hours free time to be on the computer 
                            without distraction.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Maturity. The material covered in these courses is highly technical, and I will do 
                            everything I can to simplify it and make it manageable for young students. No one knows 
                            your children better than you. Consider if your child can sit and engage material for 
                            an hour, interact with other children over complicated problems, and resolve basic 
                            arithmetic challenges.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p class="question">
                    How do I register for a course?
                </p>
