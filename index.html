                <p>
                    When God sent his chosen people, Israel, down into Egypt to survive the famine, he gave them a fertile land
                    in which they could shepherd their live quiet, peaceful, sacred lives. Though the Egyptians had no affection 
                    for Yahweh, his people could live lives oriented toward him in safety in a land called Goshen. We have adopted 
                    a similar view of our home as we raise children to know and love God in the safety of our own Goshen. As such, 
                    we seek to live quiet and peaceful lives that magnify the supremacy of Christ, and operate family trades that 
                    please him and are managed under his Lordship. This results in our radical commitment to doing what is good, 
                    honorable, and pleasing to him, even if it isn't the most financially rewarding thing, as we trust him to 
                    care for us and enable us to prosper.
