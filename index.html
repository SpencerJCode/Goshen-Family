                <p>I fell in love with the
                    idea of Golden Aussies over 3 years ago. We carefully selected our Sona (Australian Shepherd)
                    knowing we
                    were hoping to one day breed her and that she would be our foundation dog who would launch us into
                    breeding
                    2nd, 3rd, and even 4th generation Golden Aussies. We've endeavoured to start our program with
                    good quality dogs who are both registered with the American
                    Kennel Club (AKC) since it's known as one of the most prestigious registries in North America. All
                    parents have been health tested through Embark to help ensure our lines represent the best of the
                    breed. We LOVE breeding wonderful family dogs for wonderful families!
